Series P04 Extended Closing Price Data	

Fields marked with <$> indicate a <Not Null Constraint> meaning they will always be populated

Rows with SecID populated:
Primary key combo within any one file: ExchgCD + SecID + Currency + pricefilesymbol

Rows with no SecID populated but with pricefilesymbol populated:
Primary key combo within any one file: ExchgCD + Currency + pricefilesymbol

Rows with no SecID populated but with no pricefilesymbol populated:
Primary key combo within any one file: ExchgCD + Currency + Isin

Note that if pricefilesymbol is not populated it must be regarded as an <empty string> rather than <null>.

Note on historical files - Tidying up archive files to maintain primary key integrity is ongoing.
With many supplier files in different formats the possibility of anomalies getting through which break assumptions is always a possibility.
Adding precautionary fields to the primary key to allow for anomalies is not good practice. When anomalies are found/alerted the file will be fixed and resent.
